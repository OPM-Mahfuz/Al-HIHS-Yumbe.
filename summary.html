<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>
Yumbe District and the wider West Nile region face a chronic shortage of trained health professionals, severely limiting access to quality healthcare. This initiative proposes establishing a School of Health Sciences in Yumbe to train competent local professionals in nursing, midwifery, clinical medicine, and community health. The project aims to improve workforce retention, healthcare delivery, and community well-being, including constructing a mosque on campus for moral and community development. Funding will support construction, equipment, and operational costs. The project will expand access to quality health education, create employment opportunities, and improve health outcomes in the underserved region.
